# SSL-Anywhere

SSL-Anywhere is a lightweight HTTPS proxy server that enables secure access to HTTP endpoints. It serves as a bridge between HTTPS clients and HTTP servers, allowing you to maintain secure communication even when dealing with HTTP-only services.

## Problem Statement

Many legacy systems, internal services, or third-party APIs still operate over HTTP. However, modern security requirements often mandate HTTPS communication. SSL-Anywhere solves this challenge by providing a secure HTTPS endpoint that can safely proxy requests to HTTP services.

## Features

- Seamless HTTPS to HTTP proxying
- Preserves all HTTP methods (GET, POST, PUT, DELETE, etc.)
- Maintains query parameters and request bodies
- Forwards headers while ensuring proper host management
- Supports streaming responses
- Simple deployment and configuration

## Installation

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/arunsai63/ssl-anywhere.git

# Install dependencies
cd ssl-anywhere
npm install
```

## Usage

1. Start the server:
```bash
node server.js
```

2. Access HTTP endpoints through the proxy:
```
https://your-domain.com/http://target-service.com/api/endpoint
```

Example:
```javascript
// Original HTTP request
fetch('http://api.example.com/data')

// Using SSL-Anywhere
fetch('https://your-domain.com/http://api.example.com/data')
```

## Configuration

The server runs on port 8005 by default. Modify the `PORT` constant in `server.js` to change this.

For production deployment, we recommend using Nginx or similar as a reverse proxy to handle SSL termination.

## Security Considerations

- SSL-Anywhere does not perform certificate validation for target HTTP services
- Ensure your deployment follows security best practices for proxy servers
- Consider implementing request filtering and rate limiting for production use
- Monitor proxy usage and implement appropriate access controls

## Use Cases

- Accessing HTTP-only APIs from HTTPS websites
- Legacy system integration
- Development and testing environments
- Internal services requiring HTTPS compliance
